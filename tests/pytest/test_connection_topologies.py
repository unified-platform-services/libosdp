# Several PDs daisy-chained onto one RS-485 bus behind a single CP.
#
# Everything else in the suite gives each PD its own point-to-point channel, so
# none of it exercises the CP's round-robin across PDs, nor the PD-side address
# filtering that a shared wire depends on. MultidropBus puts every PD on the
# same pair of streams: each PD sees the traffic addressed to its neighbours and
# has to ignore it.
